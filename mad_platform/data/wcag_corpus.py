"""A curated subset of WCAG 2.2 success criteria -- the highest-value,
most legally-relevant ones, not exhaustive coverage of all ~90.

This set covers what Analyst's rule/AI checks actually target, plus a
handful of other criteria commonly cited in real accessibility
litigation, so Editor and Reporter have real grounding material to
retrieve against rather than a token one-criterion demo.

Descriptions here are accurate factual summaries of the standard, not
verbatim W3C text -- this is a working knowledge base, not a copy of the
spec document.
