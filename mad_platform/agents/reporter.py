"""Reporter: ranks confirmed findings by real-world risk, recommends fixes,
and drafts the report.

rank_and_recommend ranks by WCAG conformance level, real-world litigation
pattern frequency, and estimated user impact -- not raw technical severity
alone. The LLM assigns a risk score per finding; sorting by that score is
deterministic Python, not another judgment call -- code handles the
mechanical part, the model handles the actual judgment.

draft_report renders one fixed template, not a freshly generated structure
per run. The only genuinely LLM-appropriate part of the report itself is
the short executive summary; everything else is templated data fill.

Uses the higher-capability model tier -- ranking/synthesis is a judgment
call worth spending that on, unlike the high-volume per-page checks.

    assigned severities, not another judgment call.

    Penalty scales with the square root of how many findings are in each
    severity tier, not linearly with the count. The old version (a flat
    per-finding subtraction) meant 4 critical findings alone -- a real but
    fixable handful of issues -- zeroed the score outright, and nobody
    shown a 0 believes it reflects a "fix these and you're in good shape"
    site. Square-root weighting gives the first finding in a tier close to
    its full weight but flattens fast after that: 4 criticals cost about
    2x one critical (sqrt(4) = 2), not 4x. This is what makes "you're at
    65, fix your 2 critical issues and you're at 90" an honest, calculable
    claim instead of a number that can only ever read as "broken" or

key interactions are common targets; obscure AAA-only issues rarely are),

checkout form field is worse than a decorative image on a footer link).

Assign severity as one of: critical, high, medium, low.

the finding's description.
