"""Orchestrator: picks pages, sequences the cycle, checkpoints progress.

Page selection is the dynamic, LLM-driven judgment point -- not exhaustive
crawling, not a fixed list, an actual decision grounded in what's on the
entry page. Everything after that is deterministic sequencing.

A page already checkpointed all the way to "verified" is skipped entirely
on resume, not redone. A page interrupted partway through is redone from
its crawl -- crawling is cheap and idempotent, so re-fetching costs far
less than persisting large intermediate finding blobs just to save one
re-crawl.
