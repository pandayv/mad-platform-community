"""WCAG auto-heal: freshness-check + refresh loop for the shared knowledge
base. Tunes the system's knowledge, not its judgment.

Detects a version change and decides whether to auto-refresh or escalate
for human review. "Refresh" means re-embedding the curated corpus
(mad_platform/data/wcag_corpus.py) and updating the stored version
pointer -- it does not dynamically fetch and ingest new WCAG
success-criteria text from W3C.

Minor-vs-major classification leans on the model's own general knowledge
of WCAG's versioning history (2.0 -> 2.1 -> 2.2 are documented, publicly
well-known additive revisions within the same conformance model; a jump
to WCAG 3.0 is documented as a structurally different scoring model) --
stable, publicly established domain knowledge, not something that needs a
freshly-scraped changelog to get right.
