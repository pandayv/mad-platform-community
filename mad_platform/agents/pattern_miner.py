"""Pattern miner: finds recurring, consistent dismissal patterns in
Editor's own history and proposes them as calibration notes for future
scans -- the persistent-memory loop for the Analyst/Editor pipeline
itself, distinct from wcag_auto_heal's persistent memory for the shared
knowledge base.

Runs on Editor's dismissals specifically (confirmed=False, every scan),
not the rarer SME escalation queue -- Editor already independently
verifies every finding, so its own dismissal history is the high-volume,
already-real signal for "Analyst keeps making the same mistake here."

Runs on Gemini Flash via Vertex AI (adk_client), the same client every
other judgment call in this pipeline uses. Originally a self-hosted
Gemma via Ollama, kept as a separate model on purpose for the hackathon's
own judging criteria; the community fork drops that in favor of a
managed API call, since call volume here is low (one call per qualifying
WCAG-criterion cluster, weekly) and a mis-assessed pattern silently
shapes what Analyst flags on every future scan -- exactly the kind of
low-volume, high-stakes judgment call this codebase's own tiering
reserves for `FLASH`, not `FLASH_LITE`.

A mined pattern never applies itself. It's proposed as a SME-review
escalation (kind="learned_pattern", reusing the same review queue as
findings and KB version changes) and only becomes persistent memory
(firestore_client.save_learned_pattern) once a human confirms it --
Analyst's whole design is high recall on purpose ("a missed real
violation is the actual risk"), so anything that could suppress future
detection needs a person to sign off, the same way a major WCAG version
change does before the knowledge base auto-updates.
