"""AI-assisted Analyst checks -- catches what static rule checks can't.

Visual review of the screenshot (is alt text actually descriptive, are
focus indicators visible, is there a contrast issue static analysis
missed) and semantic review of accessible-name content.

These citations come from the model's own knowledge, not retrieval-
grounded lookup -- Editor is what grounds the final citation against the
WCAG knowledge base, so an ungrounded guess here is fine as a starting
point.

Analyst is deliberately high recall: the prompts below explicitly
instruct erring toward flagging borderline cases -- Editor is the
precision filter, not this layer.

_VISUAL_PROMPT = """You are an accessibility analyst reviewing a screenshot of a
rendered webpage for WCAG issues that automated static analysis cannot
catch from HTML alone. Look specifically for:
- Alt text or link text that is technically present but not actually
  descriptive of what it represents (e.g. "image1.jpg", "click here").
- Missing or unclear visual focus indicators on interactive elements.
- Text that appears to have insufficient contrast against its background,
  especially text overlaid on images or gradients.
- Confusing visual reading order or layout that would disorient a screen
  reader or keyboard user.

You are deliberately tuned toward high recall: if something looks
borderline or uncertain, flag it rather than staying silent -- a human
reviewer verifies every flag afterward, so a false alarm costs far less
than a missed violation.

For each issue found, give your best-effort WCAG 2.x success criterion
number (e.g. "1.1.1") based on your own knowledge -- these citations will
be independently verified later, so a reasonable guess is fine.

_SEMANTIC_PROMPT = """You are an accessibility analyst reviewing a webpage's
accessible-name content (alt text, aria-labels, link text) for whether it
is genuinely descriptive, not just present. You are NOT checking whether
these attributes exist -- that's already handled by a separate deterministic
check. You are judging QUALITY: does the text actually communicate what a
sighted user would perceive?

Flag cases like:
- alt text that just repeats the filename or says "image"/"photo" without
  describing content.
- Link text like "click here" or "read more" with no context about the
  destination.
- aria-label text that's generic or redundant with visible text nearby.

Deliberately high recall: flag borderline cases, a human reviewer verifies
every flag afterward.

For each issue, give your best-effort WCAG 2.x success criterion number
based on your own knowledge.

Any element marked data-mad-hidden="true" (or inside one that is) is not
currently rendered on the page -- confirmed by real computed style
(display:none, visibility:hidden, or zero size), not a guess. Don't flag
issues on hidden content as if it's an active, user-facing problem.

_MEDIA_PROMPT = """You are an accessibility analyst reviewing a webpage's HTML for
video and audio content that may not be accessible to Deaf and hard-of-hearing
users (WCAG 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only, 1.2.2 Captions).

Look for:
- Embedded video players -- YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, or similar iframe embeds
  (check the src/data-src for those domains, or common embed markup patterns).
- <audio> elements, and whether there's visible text nearby that reads like a
  transcript.

You cannot see inside a cross-origin iframe, so you cannot know for certain
whether an embedded video's captions are actually turned on -- that's a real
limit, not something to guess past. Set confidence low-to-moderate (e.g.
0.3-0.5) for embedded-player findings, and say plainly in the description
that this needs manual verification, not that it's a confirmed violation.
Native <video> tags are handled by a separate, deterministic check elsewhere
-- don't duplicate those here.

every flag afterward.
